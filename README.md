Intro
=====

Gofreerev is a play with gift network, free money and negative interest (ideas taken from Sacred Economics by Charles Einstein).

Each user has a positive or negative balance in free money and money are exchanged between users.
Negative interest is 10 % per year for negative balance and 5 % per year for positive balance.
Total balance in free money in Gofreerev will increase with between 0 and 5 % per year.

Gofreerev reads user id, name, profile url, profile picture and friends list from login provider (additional permissions can be granted by user).


Status
======

Project in development mode. Not ready for test.


Resources
=========

I could need some help with:
- Styling. Responsive layout implemented, but no other styling.
- Gems. I have implemented "show-more-rows" ajax expanding pages. It should be possible to move this feature to a gem so that it can be used in other projects.
