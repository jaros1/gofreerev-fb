gofreerev-fb
============

Distributed FB Rails app implementing free money and gift network (ideas taken from Sacred Economics by Charles Einstein)

FB is an easy way to implement a local community / network.
A better solution could be this app integrated in an open source social network.
But FB has many users ...

FREE-USD is the Free Money version of USD. Etc for other currencies.
Negative interest for Free Money is 0.02 % per day <=> 7.5 % per year

Half of the negative interest is distributed equal between all users as social divident.
That is a global negative interest 0.01 % per day <=> 3.4 % per year.
