  Welcome to <%= APP_NAME %>
</h1>
<p>
  <%= APP_NAME %> plays with some of the concepts that
  <%= link_to_charles_eisenstein %> presents in his book <%= link_to_sacred_economics %>.<br />
  I have in this game chosen facebook as community and national free money with negative interest.
  Negative Interest per year <%= NEG_INT_POS_BALANCE_PER_YEAR.round(1) %>% for positive balance
  and <%= NEG_INT_POS_BALANCE_PER_YEAR.round(1) %>% for negative balance.
  Ie both assets and liabilities diminish with time.
  <br />
  <br />
  You share the things you have in surplus and your friends might enjoy.
  Things can be for free or you can set a price at start or when the deal is closed.
  It is a game with free money and everyone has an unlimited credit.<br />
  Your balance reflects how much you have sold / purchased (delivered / received),
  is a measure for your investment in connections and
  is a measure of gratitude toward friends and community,
  but does not reflect how rich or poor your are in reality.<br />
  Free money is money with a history.
  Free money and things are closely linked and free money is not anonymous.
  E.g.. is the 300 free money from the sale of a used bike subsequently been used to buy a pair of skates.
  Now the 300 free money, two stories about a used bike and a pair of roller skates and 3 different people linked together.
  Keep the money alive, update the stories and keep in contact.
  <br />
  <br />
  <%= APP_NAME %> make postings on your wall with your offers and their story.
  Set application rights for wall stories so your community (eg your friends) can see what you offer.
  It's FB rights that determine who can see what.<br />
  <%= APP_NAME %> stores information about your balance and links to <%= APP_NAME %>'s postings on your wall,
  but not the content of the messages.
  When or if you delete the offers from your wall the connection between your balance in free money
  and your offers is lost and your free money will be boring anonymous money without history.
