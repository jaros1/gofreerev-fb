Low priority todo list. Minor errors, wishlist etc.

1) get friends friends?
   logged in as user a
   user a is friend with user b.
   b has 20  friends, but have never been logged in
   a can not see b friends until b has logged in once.

2) edit text on FB welcome pace - facebook/create
   some features are not implemented yet / text should be rewritten
   text can be seen for FB user that not yet have accepted gofreerev

4) rails.validations.js - don't look like rails.validations is used
   there was some problems with rails 4 and rails validations in summer 2013, but maybe rails 4 is supported now

5) move show-more-rows functionality to a gem if possible

6) implement other login providers

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites
   https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies
    7) Pinterest - no API at current time
    8) Tumblr - no friends
   11) DeviantArt - no friends endpoints in api reference
   12) MySpace - cannot find any usable documentation - 6 years old gem
   13) Meetup - no friends endpoints in api reference
   14) Weibo - can not signup for an account - no sms verification for denmark
   15) Odnoklassniki - one account created - cannot register app. (wrong error about missing email)
   16) Renren
   17) mixi - no friends endpoints in api reference
   18) XING - ok api with contacts - a german linkedin
   19) Kaixin001
   20) SoundCloud
   21) Goodreads
   22) Viadeo
   23) Last.fm

7) check gigya http://developers.gigya.com/037_API_reference
   Gigya markets social infrastructure technology to website operators, handling login, registration,
   user identity storage, gamification tools, and social plug-ins and APIs that collect users' personal
   data on any of several social networking services online. As of February 2013 Gigya services reached
   1.5 billion users per month

8) add/show deep link for old post?
   maybe only giver/receiver to add/show deep links
   that is - other uses can see but not share gofreerev gifts on other social media
   add allow share checkbox to user/shpw page?

9) better logger.debug2 output
   should display class.method: text class

10) my.js - replace alert with add2log and add_to_tasks_errors
    JS alert should only be used in a few situations
    But user may not see top of page and error notifications

11) gift on click. Maybe small link icons.
    - show gift on api wall.
    - show gift on gofreerev.
    deep link makes it easy to return from api to gofreerev

12) maybe get/display number of comments on api wall for each gift

13) deep link page - should be cached - without information about logged in user
    http write page with an dummy page header and without title for user divs
    that is - no login user dependent information in startup page
    after response - check if user is logged in and refresh specific user information
    ajax get page header for logged in user
    ajax get user div titles for logged in user
    is there any problems with ajax requests from search engine indexing? Expects javascript to be disabled.
    is there any problems with ajax requests when api reads page? Expects javascript to be disabled.
    cache must expire when gift changes (new status, new comments etc)

14) deep link - remember last http get - clear deep link if link has not been used for x days

15) minor problem with double locale in url. For example /da/da/users/999 for users/show links
    only for resource controllers :facebook, :gifts, :users, :inbox, :comments
    not a problem for util controller
    rails ignores the extra locale in url but is ugly
    replace resource routes with get/post spec?

17) format price
    use currency or use language to format prices?
    we are using currency now. See application controller.fetch_user

18) ajax change currency in page?
    mark each user div with user ids
    send ajax request with new currency and array with user ids in page
    receive table with new user div title with balance information in new currency
    use javascript to change title for user divs in page

19) make request for priv links (status_update and read_stream) dynamic.
    set state (random string) with js and ajax before calling api
    In that way the request priv. links will work even if user has used back bottom in browser
    there is a special problem with linkedin where "client" is temporary saved in task table

20) page header. log out link. different title for one and more than one logged in user
    returns to login provider if only one login provider
    returns to auth/index page if more than one login provider

22) new gift form. disable/enable file upload
    works with javascript, but title is not changed
    minor problem as write permission to api wall normally is not changed
    minor problem as mouse over text normally is not read by user

23) add model validation for gift.received_at:
    1) direction = both
    2) giver and receiver in api_gifts

24) check direction. added as field to gifts. check direction in source

25) check modernizr.js - where is it being user for - where is it loaded
    modernizr.js can also be used to polyfilla old browsers
    enable html5 in old browsers

27) mobile: html5 - add picture direct from camera - google html media capture - http://mobilehtml5.org/

28) mobile: how does browse file dialog look like on a mobile device?
    could be as ugly as js confirm box on devices with a small width

29) add timestamp to lines in tasks_errors for easier test & debugging
    timestamp - server timestamp or client timestamp?
    Maybe only timestamp if DEBUG_AJAX = true
    will make it easier to report problems and find relevant lines in server log
    maybe only debug log for a selected few ip-adr (testers)

30) picture size problem. First gifts/index request for a new day
    charlie gift 383. picture not resizing to width 100px.
    picture was resized to normal size after 2 minutes (looks like the next new_messages_count solved the problem)
    Only a problem with temporary local pictures.
    possible a problem with rails server and only one server instance
    test on dev1 server

31) page size: move documentation in html pages to <%# -%> tags for smaller pages and intact documentation

32) page size: shorten inline javascript code in html pages
    add helper JS functions
    for example /shared/show_more_rows

33) responsive design - missing opera plugin to set screen width.

34) responsive testing tools: http://www.gonzoblog.nl/2012/03/21/10-testing-tools-for-responsive-web-design/
    http://mattkersley.com/responsive/ can be used. Not working for localhost / gofreerev
    http://responsivepx.com can be used. Not working for localhost / gofreerev.
    Many other tools not working for localhost / gofreerev
    Neither working for dev1. Running in iframes and only auth/index page can be displayed

35) JS confirm dialog to big on 320 width screen
    JS confirm dialog can not be styled. Needs a custom dialog box
    http://lesseverything.com/blog/archives/2012/07/18/customizing-confirmation-dialog-in-rails/
    http://www.pjmccormick.com/nicer-rails-confirm-dialogs-and-not-just-delete-methods
    Not working in rails 4 - I am must be doing some ting wrong
    Tried with JS - tried with coffee script - without success

36) minor javascript problem with ajax util/currencies to get full list of currencies onfocus
    user has to click twice on currency LOV to change currency.
    the problem is that LOV object is changing at first click

39) add som kind of effect when removing gifts and comments from page
    check jquery books - check jquery ui effect demo sites - check css3 transitions

40) Use a spinner instead of a upload process bar. More generic and uses less space.

42) advance dialog box when deleting gift
    a) removed from gift from share page with unchanged balance (hide from gifts/index - show in users/show)
    b) delete gift with changed balance (delete from gifts/index and users/show
    c) cancel
    No easy was to implement this. See gift_helper.link_to_delete_gift

43) refactor styles to stylesheets - use stylesheets and not inline styles.
    responsive design added

44) add number of friends to user_div mouse over text?
    add number of mutual friends to user_div mouse over text?

45) add category to gift?
    could make it easier to find relevant gifts
    But more information to fill when posting gifts
    Could be an information that can be added after create and maybe by other users

46) allow new proposal for giver/receiver so that giver/receiver can change price?
    Or allow edit price for a not closed gift?

47) comments: timestamps for cancel, reject and accept deal?

48) Model changes - like/unlike comment?

49) edit gift. Can not edit post on api. Allow to edit post in app?

50) How much sync. of comments in api and comments in app?  now none sync. of comments. post comments on API walls?

51) mark new notifications with color in inbox.

52) convert javascript to coffeescript?

53) wrap fb api (koala) in a generic exception handler with dump of request and exception after error
    maybe already implemented!

54) gets only small picture api url from fb. See gift.get_api_picture_url method
    It should possible to get url for a larger picture from facebook api

55) gifts/index: post on api wall checkbox. Only if user has granted post-on-wall prio.
    multiple checkboxes if user is connected with write permission to multiple api walls.
    Maybe mouse over text with names of login providers walls where upload is enabled

56) auto cleanup and close of inactive accounts?!
    there is no reason to keep data for users that does not use the app ( other than delete of user and gifts changes other users balance )

57) add a counter to a gift. Normally 1 gift, but can be any number or nil. Eg. nil for a service.
    Clone a closed gift, keep the original gift and decrease counter. Close deal when counter reaches zero.
    Maybe link all the stories if accepted by the receiver

58) when closing a deal and paying with money.
    select between anonymous money without a linked story or link the money to one or more stores / other gifts
    anonymous money - no links between gifts - no story updates
    linked money - story updates

59) link stories. Insert link for one story in an other story.
    how to handle security? Should only see gifts from/to friends

60) picture store. add :host for hosted pictures

61) API_GIFT_PICTURE_STORE - allow array with values?
    for example API_GIFT_PICTURE_STORE[:linkedin] = [:facebook, :local]
    that is - use url to facebook picture or use local perm store
    user logged in with facebook and linked will use facebook as picture store
    user only logged with linkedin will use local perm picture store

62) add extra layer of encryption within html page.
    for example different public/private encryption key set for each user.

63) allow device fingerprint guest user login?
    that is login without username/password
    no friends information!
    could use user ip location and distance to other gofreerev users instead of a friend list
    user could select between api login or ip location/device fingerprint login
    check out canvas finmgerprinting
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_fingerprinting
    - http://www.version2.dk/artikel/ny-sporingsmetode-er-naesten-umulig-blokere-67937
    fingerprint gem: https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs
    could be an alternative or a supplement to cookie login

64) allow device/canvas fingerprint for users that reject cookies?
    must have table session store on server for users with device fingerprint login
