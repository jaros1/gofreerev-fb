1) DRY - only one version of all functions
   Do not repeat the same function in controller and in view helper
   Use helper_method :xxx in controllers

2) Seperate language specific texts and html layouts.
   Ok for simple html pages - not ok for complex html pages

3) Use sub folders for language specific texts.
   Ok without sub folders for 2 languages
   Not ok without sub folders for 200 languages

2+3) Implemented for /gifts/index page. Tested in english. Not tested in danish.

4) Google rails 3/4 error handling with multi language support

5) Get list of friends. Used in /gift/index to list my and my fiends gifts
