1) DRY - only one version of all functions
   Do not repeat the same function in controller and in view helper
   Use helper_method :xxx in controllers

2) Maybe allow comments to gifts in Gofreerev => Post af FB comments

3) Invite friends to app function?

4) get timezone from login api. Use timezone in views. timezone added to user. not yet any timestamps in views.

5) opera. client side validation not working in gifts/index page. Works in other browsers.

6) gifts price calculation.
   price = the agreed price
   transferred_social_dividend

7) Use ruby constants for interest in welcome page (fb/create)

8) rename controller gifts to news.

9) few price info on news wall.

10) display all friends gifts in news/index page

11) add giver balance and receiver balance to gifts.
    sort by received_at, id
    currency = users actual currency
    set/updated in user.recalculate_balance

12) gifts.balance_giver and balance_receiver should be float og bigdecimal
    Makes it easier to localize number formats

13) gifts: drop columns:
        t.text     "new_price_giver"
        t.text     "new_price_receiver"
        t.text     "currency_giver"
        t.text     "currency_receiver"
