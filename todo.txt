 1) how much information to se about deals between friends and friends friends?
    facebook: Shows status from friends on wall - do not show status from friends friends on wall
    Show gifts started by friends as giver or receiver with all pictures and comments
    Anonymous gifts started by friends friends as giver or receiver and with friends as receiver or giver
    - display received at and balance.
    - hide picture and name of friends friend
    - hide text and pictures

 2) compare JS timezone with rails timezones - there could be differences
    I have tested with copenhagen and india
    Rails timezones:
    - ActiveSupport::TimeZone.all.collect { |tz| (tz.tzinfo.current_period.utc_offset / 60.0 / 60.0).to_s }.uniq
    - ["-11.0", "-10.0", "-9.0", "-8.0", "-7.0", "-6.0", "-5.0", "-4.5", "-4.0", "-3.5", "-3.0", "-2.0", "-1.0",
       "0.0", "1.0", "2.0", "3.0", "3.5", "4.0", "4.5", "5.0", "5.5", "5.75", "6.0", "6.5", "7.0", "8.0", "9.0",
       "9.5", "10.0", "11.0", "12.0", "12.75", "13.0"]
    javascript timezones:
    wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#List_of_UTC_offsets
    wiki/rails problems: -9.5, 10.5, 11.5 and 14 is defined in wiki, but not in rails
    rails: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/TimeZone.html
    The version of TZInfo bundled with Active Support only includes the definitions necessary to support the zones
    defined by the TimeZone class. If you need to use zones that aren't defined by TimeZone, you'll need to install
    the TZInfo gem (if a recent version of the gem is installed locally, this will be used instead of the bundled version

 3) add date format. see application_helper.format_date

 4) api notifications:
    get a app access token.
    send only notifications to api if internal notifications in app is not read.
    Short summary of unread app notifications in api notification
    Only few api notifications and stop sending messages if user do not start app
    for example notification every 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28 day
    one notification every day if user connects to app.
    don't send any more notifications if user has not been connected for 28 days
    check out facebook, linkedin & twitter notification possibilities

 5) add accept conditions for new users?

 7) recalculate user balance at request or once every day

 8) user.recalculate_balance recalculates balance for all closed deals with user as giver or receiver.
    ok when few closed deals for a user, but can be a performance issue with many closed deals for a user.
    allow recalculating balance from a specific date or from a specific gift.id
    should only recalculate balance from last closed deal

 9) batch processing:
    accept new deal - set new_balance_at = yesterday - for both users - user is marked for recalculate balance (ok)
    batch processing - recalculate balance for all users where new_balance_at != today (todo)

10) check texts in views/fb/create.html.erb and create_da_html.erb

11) show a more informative page when not logged in
    ensure that all not logged users is rendered to same page (auth/index)
    this page is also index by search engines and should be informative
    maybe the same texts as in /fb/create.html.erb and create_da_html.erb pages

12) check todo's in source

13) delete api_gifts and gifts with temp picture urls - that is picture on server
    normally temp pictures will be removed in util.delete_local_picture, but errors can occur
    should be a job for util.new_messages_count or util.missing_api_picture_urls
    process could be:
    1) delete old local picturs.
    2) report missing picture to util.missing_api_picture_urls,
    3) cleanup in util.missing_api_picture_urls
    3/1-2014: temp folder was empty in laptop dev. environment
    19/1-2014: 3 pictures found in temp folder in laptop dev. environment

14) find some way to combine or group "identical" notifications in inbox/index page

15) stress test. make a db with really many rows and test performance.
    There maybe are missing an index or two
    there maybe are some sql to be rewritten

16) some problems in user.recalculate balance after splitting gifts in gifts and api_gifts
    check /auth/facebook and post_login error for price

17) twitter returns to  127.0.0.1 - not to localhost
    127.0.0.1 should redirect to localhost
    or change app setup on twitter

18) check session variables
    session variables should only be used from accessor methods in app. controller
    gives a better overview and an easier to maintain code

19) tests - needs new users.yml file - encryption now is with old userids

20) wrong flash message if user cancel request for read_stream permission
    looks like success response from facebook to facebook controller,
    but read_stream priv has not been granted.
    must double check permissions after returning from facebook priv. request page
    or old/new facebook priv. could be checked in post_login_facebook with ajax messages

21) test case:
    create deal [ a.provider1, a.provider2] as giver, [ b.provider1, b.provider2 ] as receiver, price > 0
    login as a.provider1 and b.provider2
    problem with user/show balance. logged users are giver and receiver at the same time
    must be displayed as 0 in balance
    check code with [ag.user_id_giver, ag.user_id_receiver].index(user_id)
    check code with login_user_ids.index(ag.user_id_giver)
    check code with api_gift = api_gifts.find { |ag| [ ag.user_id_giver, ag.user_id_receiver].index(???)

22) find optimal image format for each provider. For API_OG_DEF_IMAGE hash
    facebook: todo
    google+: todo
    linkedin: 180 x 110 (done)
    twitter: todo
    maybe a mouse over text with best picture dimensions

23) add mysql development environment on localhost.
    there are some select statements that are not working in mysql
    maybe is only was problem with "" around table names!

24) insert "?" picture in /user div/ temporary real profile picture has been downloaded from API
    there is a minor profile picture problem first time when a new gofreerev user logs in

25) problem after show-more-rows error
    javascript variable end_of_page is set to true and is never changed back to false
    share link does not set end_of_page variable back to false
    /gifts/index does set end_of_page back to true
    maybe use document.ready to set end_of_page to false when user clicks on share link i page header
    google a solution

26) remove api friend:
    - facebook: link to profile
    - linkedin: todo
    - google+: todo
    - twitter: todo

27) check notifications and change notification test cases to support multiple logins

28) check app on windows 8.1 / IE
    maybe it is possible to run older IE versions under windows 8.1?
    expects some javascript errors under IE

29) better github page

30) links on app setup pages to github page (wiki, report bugs etc)
    check app setup for facebook, google+, linkedin and twitter

31) post on linkedin from localhost
    can not upload picture with localhost url to linkedin
    add a special error message for this case?

32) invalid deep link requests
    deep link - return nice error page if deep link has been removed
    should display an error page
    must not redirect for not logged in users

33) add server site cleanup for api_gifts with temp url
    created in gifts/create - removed in util.delete_local_picture after post_on_<provider> tasks

34) profile picture store = :api.
    should display no-picture.jpg if user profile picture was not found

35) check if user div onclick events could be handled on a higher level - for example on document
    can not use user_id in id. user divs are repeated many times for each user.
    use data-id attribute for user.id

36) link from post on gofreerev to post on facebook. api_gift.api_gift_id => url
    but only if FB friend

37) link from post on gofreerev to post on linkedin. updateUrl
    but only if LinkedIn connection

38) facebook and open graph
    - replace api_client.put_picture and api_client.put_connections with something else to add open graph tags?
    - facebook object api: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/using-object-api/
    - koala with og.likes:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12199608/koala-like-doesn-t-work
      api_response = api.put_connections("me", "og.likes", :object => deep_link)
      can be used, but requires :local gift picture store and activity is  only shown in activity log / not on wall
    - facebook object debugger: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/

39) check response from FastImage.type(gift_file.path) if site is temporary unavailable
    should not error mark pictures if a api picture server is temporary out of service
    FastImage.type returns nil if server is temporary unavailable
    Must combine FastImage = nil with a http get page notfound check
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2695020/how-can-i-use-ruby-to-check-if-a-domain-exists

40) found class wrapword in source - used in api_gift.html.erb - could be a workaround for response web pages with small width

41) add share icons to api_gift (one icon for each api provider)
    share with a deep link
    allow all to share or allow only giver/receiver to share?
    http://jquery-plugins.net/tag/social-share-button

42) inject text into picture
    most relevant for twitter where description is truncated to about 70 characters to include deep link
    but could be an option for all login providers
    for example a merge text and picture checkbox when posting new gift
    could be relevant for other login providers where text overlay in pictures is being used

43) my.js - split gift-action-link ajax handler in one for each gift action?
    should use translated error messages in js error messages
    or use url information to customize ajax:error messages

44) my.js - split comment-action-link ajax handler in one for each comment action?
    should use translated error messages in js error messages
    or use url information to customize ajax:error messages

45) deal proposal and changed friend relations
    cancel deal proposal when friends are removed
    could be remove friends in users/index page
    could be changed api friend relation in post login provider task

46) jquery. url from xhr object is used to find html element that triggered the ajax event
    for example to setup tables for ajax error messages within gifts/index page
    it could be nice if jquery has information about the html element that started the ajax request
    $(classname).bind('click', function ... - find id for html element with classname with triggered this bind handler

47) new gift.status_update_at after new comments?
    In that way updated gifts will be at top of page and will be ajax injected to top of page
    how to keep actual user view point when ajax injecting new rows in top of page?

48) check if notification cleanup still is running. Find 68 notifications for 3 login users.

49) edit user options
    - cross provider balance y/n checkbox

50) a number of "invalid" inbox notification keys. Could be missing keys. Could be wrong notifications

    missing translate key. key .accepted_proposal_giver_follow_2_v1_to_url, noti.id 542,

51) add deleted_at to api_gift and api_comment for partial delete of gift and comment
    gift and comment created with multi provider login and one login account has been deleted

52) change User.api_gifts to include api_gifts.deleted_at information.
    that is - ajax remove gift from gifts/index page in util.new_messages_count
    delete gift for only one provider when account is closed

53) change util/new_messages_count to include delete marked api comments
    that is - ajax remove comment from gifts/index page in util.new_messages_count
    delete comment for only one provider when account is closed

54) delete account notifications.
    add some more information
    - number of deleted deals
    - sum prices for deleted deals

56) add language LOV to page header if width > xxx

57) edit/user share balance

58) performance problem in users/index page - 12 seconds for 10 rows at dev1 / my FB account

60) "false" ajax:error message if user clicks in a link before ajax request has finished.
    "tasks_form.error: error. check server log for more information."
    maybe cancel ajax requests or ignore ajax:error message when changing page
    check if there is an "before leave page" event that can be used to cancel ajax request
    or disable error from ajax:error handlers
    also a special problem in chrome where you have to link twice on links if ajax tasks is running

61) add profile picture for a new user in auth, facebook and linkedin controllers to prevent blank profile picture after login

64) gift giver pic mouse over text should have information about multiple provider givers
    gift receiver pic mouse over text should have information about multiple provider receivers

65) google+ and twitter.
    how to prevent friend invitations from people you do not know?
    F - you are following someone on google+ and twitter, and do not want to receive friend invitations from them
    S - you are stalked by someone on google+ and twitter and do not want to receive friend invitations from them
    block all and allow selected users
    allow all and block selected users

66) allow device fingerprint guest user login?
    that is login without username/password
    no friends information!
    could use user ip location and distance to other gofreerev users instead of a friend list
    user could select between api login or ip location/device fingerprint login

67) allow device fingerprint for users that reject cookies?
    must have cookie store on server for users with device fingerprint login
    could not find anything about device fingerprint session store or a device fingerprint plugins for rails

68) User.api_gifts
    maybe problem with very big select if really many friends for logged in users
    on other option could be 2 sub queries combined with filter for deselected friends
    select * from api_gifts
    where user_id_giver in (select ...) and user_id_giver not in (1,2,3, ..)
    or    user_id_receiver in (select ...) and user_id_receiver not in (1,2,3, ..)

69) check set_timezone task
    it looks like it is running too often
    should only run once during login

70) users/index status mouse over with number of mutual friends was been dropped
    maybe add a ajax mouse over title - that is - calculate number of mutual friends when needed and not always
    good performance at startup and nice to have for the users when selecting friends

71) check out JS API's for facebook, linkedin, google+ and twitter
    some not supported server site operations could be implemented with client side JS

72) users/index - friends of friends - why in list - show name(s) of friend
    maybe the same issue as in previous dropped mutual friends

75) find a better location for ajax tasks spinner
    show/hide spinner makes the page to bounce
    add mouse over title to ajax tasks title with explanation.

76) add mini spinners for some time consuming tasks.
    for example deleting a closed deal (recalculate balance)

77) Midori: problems with utf-8 in some paths of gifts/index page - looks like a temporary problem

79) users/index: search, friend name filter or alphabetical tabs
    it is slow to scroll down (bad performance + 3 seconds delay for each 10 rows lookup)
    ( still problem with bad performance in users/index page )

80) chrome and running ajax tasks
    you have to click twice on links if an ajax tasks is running when clicking on link
    ajax error message at first click and http request at second click
    not a problem in firefox, opera, IE or Midori.

81) opera 12.16 bug when gofreerev starts from facebook https://apps.facebook.com/gofreerev-dev/
    Warning
    https://dev1.gofreerev.com/
    A page on the public internet requests data from your private intranet. For security reasons, automatic access is blocked, but you may choose to continue.

    Second https://apps.facebook.com/gofreerev-dev/ request => post /
    Opera console does not reveal any rejected localhost requests. But should not start with get /

82) opera. displays auth/index page within facebook iframe when gofreerev starts from facebook.

84) ajax error message in inbox page:
    #check-new-messages-link::ajax:success: show_more_rows_scroll failed: ReferenceError: get_more_rows_table is not defined
    The problem is in #check-new-messages-link:ajax:success handler
    Should only call show_more_rows_scroll() in pages where scroll is enabled (gifts, users)

85) localhost / login servers Sandra/fb and Gofreerev A/gp
    2+2 notifications. 2 accepted and 2 accepted follow notification.
    for example 13. feb. 2014 11.58
    should only send notification to Sandra+Gofreerev as creator of proposal.
    should not send notification to Sandra+Gofreerev as follower of proposal.
    the same pattern for "outbox" for Jan R/google+ as sender of message.
    also 13. feb. 2014 11.58

86) add a API check to omniauth.rb og environment.rb
    check that all array constrants are initialized for all login providers

    easy to copy gofreerev and misuse the concept.
    maybe a list of officiel gofreerev sites

88) users/index apiname=<provider> filter. Use login user = selected provider.
    in that way all user pictures are from the same login provider.

89) ajax spinner is missing while fetchning new exchange rates

90) check if there is a generic JS way to count number of running/pending ajax requests

91) find all methods with case provider implementations. Should be listed in todo for adding a new login provider.
    maybe add a special search word that can be used to find all relevant points in source code when adding a new login provider
    add "API SETUP" comment for all case provider statements

94) auth/index & wide screen
    two columns with api providers

95) users/index friends filter: add follows and followed by filters?

    - add missing provider? note. add a github page with request for missing login providers

99) users/edit change language
    - add note and link to github with instructions to how to add a new language to app
    - add github page about changing translations and adding new languages

100) linkedin gem. frozen to an old version due to error. Unfreeze when error is solved

101) check if there is a problem with missing state in omniauth login.
     normally state should be included when using omniauth and callbacks

102) refactor linkedin & flickr translate keys into shared? Almost identical translations

103) flickr & twitter.
     use phantomjs to convert text to image before upload to API.
     - test if it can be installed on plug server
     - add method to Picture for generating image from text
     - check best width for flickr and twitter. width must be a param
     - css text effects. For example color, shadow
     - twitter. use if description > 70 characters and no picture
     - flickr. use if no picture

     add a page for Gofreerev and ?
     maybe j has some ideas

105) gifts/index new gift text area is not resize to small size after post with a long text

107) picture.create_png_image_from_text
     only png image looks nice
     there should be support for jpg, jpeg, gif, png and bmp

109) problem with post from an empty gifts/index page
     rails post ok. client js fails with
     insert_update_gifts: 3 gifts lines in old page
     insert_update_gifts: error - id with format format gift-<999>- was not found
     in log and no error messages in page header
     on post_in_<provider> task was started

110) check out open graph meta-tags in flickr.
     maybe some that could by used
     <meta property="fb:app_id" content="137206539707334" />
     <meta property="al:ios:app_store_id" content="328407587" />
     <meta property="al:ios:app_name" content="Flickr" />
     <meta property="twitter:app:name:iphone" content="Flickr" />
     <meta property="twitter:app:id:iphone" content="328407587" />
     <meta property="og:title" content="u6bbc6h8oy" />
     <meta property="og:type" content="flickr_photos:photo" />
     <meta property="og:url" content="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gofreerev/12593199523/" />

     <meta property="twitter:app:url:iphone" content="flickr://flickr.com/photos/gofreerev/12593199523/" />

113) check just_posted variable in get_api_picture_url_<provider> methods
     should raise exception if just posted and picture was not found.
     see get_api_picture_url_facebook

115) two or three column friend list in users/index page.
     responsive design or use javascript to organize table layout

116) post on twitter: Exception: execution expired (Twitter::Error) after 6 seconds
     added exception to post on twitter for debug
     maybe a generic way to handle execution expired when posting on api walls
     repeat up to 3 times before giving up
     return warning to user and try once more time
     delete_local_picture task and expired post on wall exception!

117) post on twitter - description > 70
     no picture - convert text to image - keep hash tags in shorten text
     picture - convert text to image - append or overlay text to image - keep hash tags in short text
