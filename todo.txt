1) DRY - only one version of all functions
   Do not repeat the same function in controller and in view helper
   Use helper_method :xxx in controllers

2) Seperate language specific texts and html layouts.
   Ok for simple html pages - not ok for complex html pages

3) Use sub folders for language specific texts.
   Ok without sub folders for 2 languages
   Not ok without sub folders for 200 languages

2+3) Implemented for /gifts/index page. Tested in english. Not tested in danish.

4) Google rails 3/4 error handling with multi language support

5) Get list of friends. Used in /gift/index to list my and my fiends gifts

6) Maybe allow gift post without update_status priv.
   That is, gifts is only posted in Gofreerev, not on FB wall
   Only friends that also are using Gofreerev can see postings in Gofreerev

7) Maybe allow comments to gifts in Gofreerev => Post af FB comments

8) Invite friends to app function?

9) replace language functions with I18n functions

12) get timezone from login api. Use timezone in views. timezone added to user. not yet any timestamps in views.
