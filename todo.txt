1) DRY - only one version of all functions
   Do not repeat the same function in controller and in view helper
   Use helper_method :xxx in controllers

2) Maybe allow comments to gifts in Gofreerev => Post af FB comments

3) Invite friends to app function?

4) get timezone from login api. Use timezone in views. timezone added to user. not yet any timestamps in views.

5) opera. client side validation not working in gifts/index page. Works in other browsers.

6) gifts price calculation.
   price = the agreed price
   transferred_social_dividend

7) Use ruby constants for interest in welcome page (fb/create)

9) few price info on gifts/index page. More information in user/show balance view
   More information available in titles

10) display all friends gifts in news/index page

13) gifts: drop columns:
        t.text     "new_price_giver"
        t.text     "new_price_receiver"
        t.text     "currency_giver"
        t.text     "currency_receiver"

14) BigDecimal and/or floats. Where to use BigDecimal and where to user Floats?
    Speed is more important than accuracy
    Change all BigDecimal to Float

15) Change received_at from Date to Datetime

16) add flash message if currency change failed.

17) exchanged social dividend is displayed as gifts in gists/index view, but social dividend = negative_interest / 4 is missing in balance.
    add social dividend (negative_interest / 4) to balance.
    display social dividend in format_user_balance
    add key with social dividend to balance hash
    social dividend is splitted in currencies.
    maybe add a negative interest / social dividend hash to user
    maybe add a system user - negative currency could be gifts from users to system user and social dividend gifts from system user to users

18) Check da texts in rails-i18n

21) gift.description. change field name in model validation to offer.
