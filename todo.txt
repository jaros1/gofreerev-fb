1) DRY - only one version of all functions
   Do not repeat the same function in controller and in view helper
   Use helper_method :xxx in controllers

2) Maybe allow comments to gifts in Gofreerev => Post af FB comments

3) Invite friends to app function?

4) get timezone from login api. Use timezone in views. timezone added to user. not yet any timestamps in views.

5) opera. client side validation not working in gifts/index page. Works in other browsers.
